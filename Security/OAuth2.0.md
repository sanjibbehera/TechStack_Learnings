## Understanding OAuth 2.0
OAuth is an open standard that allows users to grant limited access to their data on one site to other sites or applications without exposing their passwords.  
It has become the backbone of secure authorization across the web and mobile apps.

## The OAuth Ecosystem
OAuth connects three main players:  
- The User who wants to grant access to their data without sharing login credentials
- The Server that hosts the user's data and provides access tokens
- The Identity Provider (IdP) that authenticates the user's identity and issues tokens
